About Cypress:
Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. We address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing modern applications.
Cypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different. Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium.
This enables you to write faster, easier and more reliable tests

## Who uses Cypress?
Our users are typically developers or QA engineers building web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks.

Cypress enables you to write all types of tests:

End-to-end tests
Integration tests
Unit tests
Cypress can test anything that runs in a browser.

## clone this repo to a local directory
git clone  https://github.com/PramodKokadwar/TaskAeternityAutomationScript.git

## cd into the cloned repo
cd cypress-example-pramodkokadwar

## install the node_modules
npm install

npm start
The npm start script on port 8080  

You can verify this by opening your browser and navigating to: http://localhost:8080

## launch the cypress test runner
npm run cy:open
shortcut: you can use command npm run local:open that uses start-server-and-test to start local server and open Cypress. When you close Cypress, the local server is stopped automatically. Similarly you can use npm run local:run to start the server, run Cypress tests headlessly and close the server.
